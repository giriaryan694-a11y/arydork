ARYDORK – ChatGPT-Assisted Dorking for Bug Bounty

Overview
ARYDORK is a concept for ethical bug bounty hunting that combines AI-assisted dork generation, Google search, and ChatGPT-powered source code analysis.

Due to Google’s anti-bot measures, live scraping is not feasible, so this project demonstrates how ChatGPT can be leveraged for generating dorks and analyzing source code, while Google can be used manually to search for vulnerable targets.

Features

1. Dork Generation with ChatGPT
   - Generate advanced vulnerability dorks automatically.
   - Focused on SQLi, LFI, XSS, RCE, and exposed configuration files.

2. Manual or Automated Google Search
   - Use generated dorks to search on Google.
   - Due to security measures, direct scraping is not recommended; manual search or Google Custom Search API can be used.

3. Source Code Analysis with ChatGPT
   - Once a vulnerable page is identified, its source code or HTML can be analyzed by ChatGPT for vulnerabilities.
   - Highlights potential injection points, misconfigurations, or insecure practices.

Workflow

1. Generate Dorks
   Example: inurl:".php?id=" "You have an error in your SQL syntax"
   Example: inurl:"search" "q=" "Warning: mysql_fetch_assoc()"
   Example: filetype:env "DB_PASSWORD"

2. Search Targets
   - Copy a generated dork into Google search manually:
     https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:".php?id="+%22You+have+an+error+in+your+SQL+syntax%22
   - Identify live vulnerable pages for testing in safe environments.

3. Analyze Source Code
   - Use ChatGPT to analyze HTML or source snippets:
     Input: HTML snippet from target page
     ChatGPT Output: Possible SQL injection point detected, unsanitized parameters: id

4. Safe Testing
   - Only test on legally authorized environments such as:
     http://testphp.vulnweb.com/
     http://testhtml5.vulnweb.com/
     http://rest.vulnweb.com/

Ethical Disclaimer & Legal Warning

- ARYDORKER is intended for educational purposes, bug bounty programs, and testing in legally authorized environments only.
- Unauthorized scanning, exploiting, or hacking of websites without explicit permission is illegal and may result in criminal and civil penalties.
- Misusing AI models (including ChatGPT) for malicious purposes, hacking, or illegal activity is strictly prohibited and can lead to action by the service provider (OpenAI) in addition to legal consequences.
- Always ensure you have explicit authorization from the system owner before performing any security testing.
- Use this project responsibly to learn, practice, and contribute to cybersecurity ethically.

Benefits

- AI-assisted dorking speeds up reconnaissance.
- No risk of Google bans when using ChatGPT for generation.
- Ethical bug bounty testing using safe test targets.
- ChatGPT source analysis can highlight potential vulnerabilities without manual effort.

Example Usage

1. Ask ChatGPT to generate vulnerability dorks for SQLi:
   "Generate 10 SQLi Google dorks targeting PHP websites"
2. Copy the dorks to Google manually and identify targets.
3. Save the HTML source code of pages.
4. Feed the source to ChatGPT for vulnerability analysis.

# ARYDORK Guide – Bug Bounty + AI + Dorking

##⚡ Introduction

ARYDORK is a step-by-step educational guide for bug bounty enthusiasts and security researchers. It shows how to combine AI, Google dorking, and code analysis to learn about web vulnerabilities in a safe and responsible way.

Note: This guide is meant for learning and authorized bug bounty programs only.

## 1️⃣ Dork Generation with AI

- Use ChatGPT to create creative Google dorks for reconnaissance. Example:

- Ask ChatGPT: “Generate Google dorks to find potential vulnerabilities in testphp.vulnweb.com for learning purposes”

- ChatGPT can suggest patterns like:

- inurl:".php?id=" site:testphp.vulnweb.com

- "Warning: mysql_fetch_assoc()" site:testphp.vulnweb.com

- Always generate dorks ethically and use them on authorized labs only.

## 2️⃣ Recon Using Google

- Search the generated dorks manually on Google.

- Analyze results for educational insights.

- Avoid automated scraping to prevent IP issues or account restrictions.

- Reminder: Using these methods without explicit authorization is considered unethical. Stick to bug bounty programs and learning labs.

## 3️⃣ AI-Powered Source Code Analysis

- Collect publicly available code snippets from websites or open repositories.

- Use ChatGPT to study the code for learning about:

- SQL patterns and queries

- Input validation

- Authentication flows

- Safe coding practices

- ChatGPT is a learning assistant — it should never be used on systems without permission.

## 4️⃣ Ethics & Authorized Use Disclaimer

-ARYDORK is for educational and authorized bug bounty purposes only.

-Do not use these methods on systems without explicit permission.

-Misuse can lead to:

- Account restrictions on platforms

- thical violations

- Consequences from AI service providers (e.g., OpenAI) if AI is used inappropriately

- Focus on learning, research, and safe experimentation. Always stay authorized and responsible.

## 5️⃣ Practical Tips for Learners

- Use bug bounty programs or legal labs like testphp.vulnweb.com for experiments.
- Document your learning and observations carefully.

Use AI as a support tool for understanding and research, not for unauthorized exploration.

- Share your findings ethically and responsibly.
